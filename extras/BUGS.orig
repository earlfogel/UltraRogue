1)	messages longer than screen width wipe out part of the upper line of
	the level.  endmsg() in io.c should be changed to test for
	these things.
2)	when you are in a darkened room and a monster moves across the
	doorway, the doorway goes blank instead of staying as a plus.
	this also happens in a lit room if the monster is invisible.
	problem is in chase.c
