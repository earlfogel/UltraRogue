This software builds on linux and windows.  Probably other *nix's too,
but I haven't tried.

To build urogue, change to the rogue directory and type make:

    cd rogue
    make

Normally urogue stores any files it needs in the user's home directory,
but if you want, it can use a shared score file on multi-user systems.
To use a shared score file, edit tunable.c to set the file path, then
create an empty file at that location and make it writable by anyone who
will be playing urogue.


Building on Windows
-------------------

To build on Windows, I use msys2 and mingw.

Download msys2 from www.msys2.org.

Run msys2 (from Start Menu). This gives you a unix-like shell window.

Now update msys2:

  $ pacman -Syu
  If needed, close msys2 window and run it again.

Now update the packages included with msys2:

  pacman -Su

To install additional packages:

  pacman -S vim
  pacman -S diffutils file grep make mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pdcurses

Now run a MinGW 64-bit shell (from Start Menu).

Build urogue and copy it to Windows along with any required DLLs:

  cd rogue
  make -f Makefile.win
  mkdir /c/urogue
  cp urogue.exe /c/urogue
  cp /mingw64/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll /c/urogue
  cp /mingw64/bin/libpdcurses.dll /c/urogue

Run it:

  cmd
  c:
  cd \urogue
  urogue.bat

Edit urogue.bat to set options or change the window size.
